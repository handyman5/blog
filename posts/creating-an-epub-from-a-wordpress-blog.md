Recently, I wanted to create epubs of some reading material, specifically some Wordpress-hosted blogs. Rather than implementing a separate script for each blog I wanted an epub from, I wrote a tool to figure it all out for me: [trivialpub](https://github.com/handyman5/trivialpub).

Usage is simple: provide a YAML config file, such as:

``` yaml
toc_url: https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/
toc_parser: |
  [x.get('href') for x in soup.select('div.entry-content a') if 'class' not in x.attrs]

```

And trivialpub will do the rest:

``` shell
$ ./trivialpub.py -c practicalguide.yaml

$ ls -l build/
total 9216

```

I’ve included a number of examples in the repo, but basically, you either need to feed it a list of URLs to transform or a Python expression which, when eval’ed in context, will generate a list of URLs. (Yes, yes, eval() is the devil, I know.)

PRs and suggestions welcome.
