_(originally from [https://web.archive.org/web/20150421212536/http://ajcsystems.com/blog/blog/2012/10/06/poodledo-library-updated/])_

I spent some time the past few days updating and improving the Python library I maintain for integrating with [Toodledo](http://www.toodledo.com/). The big new features I’m excited about are automatically tab-completing your folders, goals, etc. when creating a new task (as I can never remember exactly what I called them without checking), and adding multi-line notes. Now I can add a new task, pick out the right project and such right from the command line, and ramble on to add whatever other notes I want to write down right there.

I’m hoping that this new set of features will help me get back in the habit of adding new tasks directly to Toodledo, instead of just writing them in a text file and going back to reprocess them later. ![:-P](https://web.archive.org/web/20150421212536im_/http://ajcsystems.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif)
