I’ve read and enjoyed parts of [Michael O. Church’s](https://web.archive.org/web/20201205012321/https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/ "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205012321/https://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/") take on Venkatesh Rao’s [Gervais Principle](https://web.archive.org/web/20201205012321/http://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/ "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205012321/http://www.ribbonfarm.com/the-gervais-principle/"), but he took his blog offline before I was able to read them all. I decided to snag copies of all of the posts from [the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20201205012321/https://archive.org/web/ "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205012321/https://archive.org/web/") and turn them into an ebook for convenient reading. This appears to be a solved problem thanks to [this handy little Python library, pypub](https://web.archive.org/web/20201205012321/https://pypub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205012321/https://pypub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"), but just in case it winds up being useful to someone here is what I did.

### Building the list of links


I googled for the first post, looked it up in the Wayback Machine, noted a working URL, and kept following links until I found all of the posts in the series.


For reference, here they are.

### Creating the ebook


[pypub](https://web.archive.org/web/20201205012321/https://pypub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "https://web.archive.org/web/20201205012321/https://pypub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/") made this bit super easy!



```
import pypub, os
epub = pypub.Epub('Gervais Principle Questioned')
urls = open('links.txt').read()
real_urls = [x for x in urls.split() if x.startswith('https:')]
for u in real_urls:
  c = pypub.create_chapter_from_url(x)                                                                                                     
  epub.add_chapter(c)          
epub.create_epub(os.getcwd())  

```

Et voila!
