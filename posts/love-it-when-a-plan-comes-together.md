I recently purchased a [HDHomeRun Prime](https://web.archive.org/web/20150504012625/http://www.silicondust.com/products/hdhomerun/prime/) to replace my first-gen HDHomeRun, with the intention of using a CableCard to replace my ugly kludge of grabbing video from a cable box via Firewire. TL;DR – it just worked.

I set up the new HDHR and pointed MythTV at it, and it was detected and set up easily. I chatted with Comcast’s online tech support to ask how to get a CableCard, and they said I could either have a tech deliver one or pick it up myself at a service center. I opted to drive to the service center, where I waited for just a couple of minutes in a line of three people. The desk representative knew what a CableCard was and dug one out for me in a flash; I don’t think I was in the building more than five minutes. When I got home, I connected it to the new HDHR and went through the online activation process. After about a half-hour (as they warned me it might take that long), I fired up mythtv-setup and tried to scan channels on the CableCard. It worked great the first time, all of the channels and schedules downloaded, and I was able to start watching every channel I cared about on my HTPC immediately.

It’s so very rare that everything just works the way it’s supposed to with all this high-tech computer stuff, I like to savor the moments when things do go well. I had read a lot of horror stories on the web before planning all of this, but I couldn’t be happier about how it’s worked out.

Now to resolve the issue with the OpenGL UI painter so the program guide can occupy the entire screen… it’s good to know that there’ll always be something else to fix, too.
