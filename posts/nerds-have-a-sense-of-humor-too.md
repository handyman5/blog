This will also be a place for me to foment discussions and post funny or interesting things that would not be of general interest to my LiveJournal folk.

Case in point: [The ABCs of Linux](https://web.archive.org/web/20150421220346/http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2006/12/humor-get-your-abcs-of-linux-right.html), which is quite geeky and entertained me thoroughly. I’m pleased that I knew all of the commands except for the one for “O”.

Well, pleased and distraught in equal measure. ![;-)](/images/icon_wink.gif)
