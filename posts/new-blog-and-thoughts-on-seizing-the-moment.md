Well, hello there! I've once again schlepped my writing to a new blog platform. After getting tired of trying to write in Medium's web editor, I wanted to go with something based on text files. I looked into setting up something hosted (like <https://write.as>), but digging into the feature set and pricing left my head spinning. What really got me going though was this post about [using Bluesky replies as blog comments](https://graysky.app/blog/2024-02-05-adding-blog-comments). Incorporating something like that basically required a self-hosted system (so I could tweak the template enough to incorporate it).

This reminds me of a broader point that I have to remind myself of all the time. It can be hard and scary to start something new; there's a thousand reasons not to do something, a thousand obstacles and rationales why this is the wrong thing at the wrong time, etc. The antidote to that inertia is, when the muse strikes, grab on with both hands and follow it as far as it can possibly take you. Those instances where the stars align and you have the time and energy and ambition all falling into place together are so rare and precious, I think it's imperative to use them, even if you haven't planned everything out or don't know exactly where you're going to wind up. There's a saying about "[the tyranny of the blank page](https://medium.com/@penguinrandomus/the-tyranny-of-the-blank-page-4-writing-tips-from-andy-weir-709992be37b7)", which refers to how the hardest part of a creative endavor is going from _nothing_ to _something_. Once you're over that hump, you have some forward momentum, and it's a lot easier to refine something that already exists (even in a crappy, raw form).

Kairos and praxis, taking the correct action at the exact right moment, can deliver wildly disproportionate results. But you have to set yourself up for success by giving yourself a place to start from, whenever you can.
