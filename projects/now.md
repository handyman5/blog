Updated 2024-07-12.

## New Job

I recently started working at <https://wayve.ai/> as a Principal Engineer. It's been a couple of months and I'm still learning a lot, which I'm jazzed about.

## Personal Projects

### Smarter Speaker

I've been working on setting up a locally-hosted smart speaker, leveraging Home Assistant's ability to [let a LLM control its devices](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2024/06/05/release-20246/#voice--assist). My goal is to have an Alexa-style smart speaker that a) is completely under my control and b) can be extended to do lots more interesting things, and more compound actions, than Alexa possibly can.

I've made good progress but it's not 100% working yet. I'll write up a [project page](/projects) here once I've got it sorted.

## Life

It's summer here, and the kids are out of school and doing their various camps and summer activities. I'm personally ready for school to start again already!
